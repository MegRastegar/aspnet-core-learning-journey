# ASP.NET Core Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my journey in learning **ASP.NET Core**. As I progress through different projects and practice applications, I will update this repo with links to each project along with brief descriptions of what Iâ€™ve learned. This is a continuous journey as I explore the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, user authentication, database interactions, and other ASP.NET Core features.

## Projects

| Project Name | Description | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| JokeApp | A simple joke database where users can view and contribute jokes. Built to practice MVC and user authentication. | [JokeApp Repository](https://github.com/MegRastegar/JokeApp) |

*Check back for updates as I complete more projects!*

## Goals for this Journey
1. **Learn the basics of ASP.NET Core**: Understand how to create and structure ASP.NET Core applications.
2. **Practice with MVC Architecture**: Implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate concerns.
3. **Explore User Authentication**: Learn how to add and manage user accounts securely.
4. **Database Interactions**: Get hands-on experience with Entity Framework and databases.
5. **Build RESTful APIs**: Create and consume REST APIs in ASP.NET Core.

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core**
- **Visual Studio**
- **SQL Server or SQLite** (for database projects)
